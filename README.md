## Overview

This Python application, titled `CODE DB INDEX.PY`, is designed to scan directories, index file structures, and analyze Python files using a Tkinter-based graphical user interface. It integrates with SQLite for data storage and employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) via spaCy and nltk for advanced file handling and analysis.



## Features

- **Directory Scanning**: Efficiently scans directories for files, with a focus on Python (.py) and Markdown (.md) files.

- **SQLite Database Integration**: Stores file paths and NLP-generated vector representations of file names in an SQLite database.

- **File Analysis**: Parses Python files to extract and display class and function names, along with their line numbers.

- **NLP Integration**: Utilizes spaCy to generate vector representations of file names for advanced analysis.

- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Implements multi-threading for efficient, non-blocking GUI operations.

- **Interactive GUI**: Provides an intuitive interface to view and interact with the file structure and contents.



## Installation

To run this application, ensure the following prerequisites are installed:

- Python 3.x

- Tkinter (usually comes bundled with Python)

- spaCy and nltk for NLP operations

- SQLite3 for database interactions



Run the following commands to install necessary packages (if not already installed):

pip install spacy pip install nltk python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

yaml



## Usage

- Start the application by running the Python script.

- Use the "Scan Directories and Index" button to start scanning directories.

- The application will display the files in a tree view, and users can select individual files to view details.

- The GUI provides information about file paths, vector representations, classes, functions, and the file content.



## Logging

The application includes logging for monitoring operations and troubleshooting.



## Note

This application is designed primarily for educational and demonstration purposes. It showcases the integration of various Python libraries and technologies.
